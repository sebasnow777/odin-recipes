<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This famous authentic Roman pasta carbonara is a delicious treat and 
   provides a rich and creamy sauce without using any actual cream.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>100 grams of dry Spaghetti Pasta</li>
       <li>30 grams of grated Pecorino Romano</li>
       <li>30 grams of grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
       <li>1 whole egg </li>
       <li>Pancetta</li>
       <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>

  <ol>
      <li>First, set a pan to low heat and place your pancetta on the pan. Slowly cook it until the fat renders out and the outsides are golden brown and 
        and the insides are still soft.Once the fat is rendered out and the pancetta is cooked you may leave it on the pan until your pasta is ready.</li>   
      <li>Boil a large pot of water with 1 tablespoon of rock salt. Cook your pasta according to the ingredients on the package.</li>
      <li>Then, While your pasta is cooking combine one beaten whole egg with your grated cheeses and mix until you form a clump of egg and cheese.</li>
      <li>Third, once your pasta is close to cooking scoop a mug of pasta water and keep on the side. The starches within the pasta water will help
        to melt the cheese and emulsify the ingredients into a creamy sauce.</li>
      <li>Next, reheat your pancetta if it has been sitting for a while and add your cooked pasta to the pan with the pancetta. Toss and cook for
        a minute in order to allowe the oils and flavor of the pancetta to coat the cooked sphagetti with flavor.</li>
      <li> Turn off the heat and add your clump of egg and cheese in the pan with your pasta. Heat is not necessary any longer because cooking with 
        heat will result in scrambled eggs. Add about a quarter of the pasta water you saved from your mug earlier and start mixing and tossing
        your pasta in order to create the creamy emulsion from the residual heat of the pasta and pancetta in the pan.</li>
      <li> Keep on adding pasta little by little to help melt the cheese and create the consistency you are looking for.</li>  
      <li> Finish the pasta with a generous amount of black pepper and serve on a plate finishing off with a desired amount of grated cheese.</li>
