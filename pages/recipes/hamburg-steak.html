    <img src="../../images/hamburg.jpg" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;" alt="picture of a Japanese Hamburge steak"> 
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a western influenced Japanese dish that is commonly served in Japanese restaurants as well as made at home. Despite
        it being named with the name steak, this dish is actually made from a combination of minced pork and beef in a specific beef/pork 
        ratio either 2:1 (8 oz/4 oz) or 3:1 (9 oz/3 oz). You can also stuff it with cheese if you so desire. This was a dish I made for my wife 
        that I served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. A demi glace sauce is usually served on top but as real demi glace is difficult
        to make you can use store bought demi glace mix or sauce. An alternate option would be creating a pan sauce.</p>

        <li>300grams of pork and beef minced. (Creates servings of 2 in 150 grams each</li>
